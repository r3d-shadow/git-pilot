## 🚀 Why Git-Pilot?

Managing configuration and CI/CD files across 10, 20, or 100+ repositories is a nightmare.

**`git-pilot` is your autopilot for repository file sync.** It brings GitOps discipline, Helm-style templating, and one-command sync to modern DevOps pipelines.

### 🧠 Built for DevEx

* **One command to sync them all:** Apply templates to any number of GitHub repos in one go.
* **Helm-style power:** Use partials, macros (`.tpl`), and regex-driven rendering logic.
* **Preview before you push:** Interactive side-by-side diffs before anything is committed.
* **State-aware syncs:** Tracks changes and removes stale files automatically.
* **Per-repo flexibility:** Custom branches, commit messages, and variable overrides.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install git-pilot
```

---

## ✨ Getting Started: First Sync in 5 Minutes

### 1. Initialize Template Directory

```bash
git-pilot init --template-dir my-templates
```

This creates a sample structure with:

* Example templates (`*.yml.j2`)
* Partials in `includes/`
* Helper macros in `_helpers.tpl`
* A working `values.yml` config

---

### 2. Customize Templates and Values

Edit `my-templates/values.yml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  branch: main
  message: "git-pilot: update workflows"
  path: ".github/workflows"
  vars:
    ci_name: my-pipeline
    env: dev
  templates:
    - ".*\.j2$"

repos:
  - name: r3d-shadow/git-pilot-test-1
    vars:
      job_id: scan1
  - name: r3d-shadow/git-pilot-test-2
    branch: main # override
    vars:
      job_id: scan2
      env: prod # override
```

---

### 3. Run Your First Sync

```bash
cd my-templates

git-pilot sync \
  --token $GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --templates ./ \
  --values ./values.yml
```

✅ You’ll see a full visual diff. Confirm to sync. That’s it!
